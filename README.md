Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual  developer and as part of a development team?

One of Version Control Systems (VCS) most important capabilities is its means of supporting collaboration across a team of developers working on a project. VCS’s can adequately track team members using “branches,” which are used to create multiples copies of the same project for individual team members to work on. Those changes only become merged with the main projects after the entire development team are satisfied with there work. This method of operating tackles the problems involved in tracking changes made by the members of the development team and greatly decreases the probability of overwriting another team members work (Tsitora 2020).

From the perspective of an individual developer, you may want to keep previously written code or revert to different aspects of an already completed project. VCS can achieve this as it allows you to revert a selected file back to a previous version of itself. You can revert an entire project back to a pervious version of itself and then use the stripped back version of the project as the foundations to develop a new project, saving the time and effort involved in conducting the groundwork. You can also revert an ongoing project to a previous state to identify and modify something that’ is causing issues in the code (Chacon and Straub 2023).
