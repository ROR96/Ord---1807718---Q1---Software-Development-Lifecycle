Why is a Version Control System useful when developing software both as an individual  developer and as part of a development team?

One of Version Control Systems (VCS) most important capabilities is its means of support collbaration across a team of developers working on a project. VCS’s can adequately track members through the use of “branches,” which are used to create multiples copies of the project for the individual team members to work on. Those changes only become merged with the main projects afyer the entire development team are satifised with there work. This method of operating tackles the problems involved in tracking changes made by the members of the development team and greatly decreases the probability of overwriting another team emebers work.
